# Paratus

This website has been made to address the need of increasing financial literacy among teens in the USA. 

I predominantly used HTML and CSS for the front end. For the backend of the code we used Django with python. I have one snippet of JavaScript for the collapsible function. 
Due to being relatively new to django I had to use online resources to aid me in the process such as, stackoverflow.com, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1aC-KwB98o, and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe9nqlirjacLkBYdgc2inh3. For HTML and CSS aid I used w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com.

## Dependencies

1. Django 3.0.8
2. Python 3.8.5

## Running the project

1. To run the project you will need to download both django and python on your computer. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/install/ This website can help you with the installation. (one time setup)

2. Then in you command prompt you will go to the project folder C:...Paratus\paratus> and run the command :
   python manage.py runserver
   
3. Copy the localhost link that your command prompt shows you and you will be able to see the website. Preferably use an incognito window or a new google window to ensure cache and cookies do not interfere with the website.
