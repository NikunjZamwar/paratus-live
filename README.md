# Paratus

This website has been made to address the need of increasing financial literacy among teens in the USA. 

Our team was Mani Ganna, Nikunj Zamwar, Rohan Phadke, and Sami Ahmad

We predmoinantly used HTML and CSS for the front end. For the backend of the code we used Django with python. We have one snippet of JavaScript for the collapsible function. 
Due to being relatively new to django we had to use online resources to aid us in the process such as, stackoverflow.com, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1aC-KwB98o, and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe9nqlirjacLkBYdgc2inh3. For HTML and CSS aid we used w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com.

## Dependencies

1. Django 3.0.8
2. Python 3.8.5

## Running the project

1. To run the project you will need to download both django and python on your computer. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/install/ This website can help you with the installation. (one time setup)

2. Then in you command prompt you will go to the project folder C:...Paratus\paratus> and run the command :
